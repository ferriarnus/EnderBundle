!!! IMPORTANT: The creative menu is completely client side, making it not work inside this inventory. Use it in any other inventory and it works. !!!

Ender Bundle is a 1.17 vanilla + style Forge mod, inspired on the "item shadowing" glitch. It adds an ender bundle and hopper, who can be linked to each other.
The bundle and hopper then share the same inventory and you are able take and put items in the inventory via the bundle and hopper.

Ender Bundle


The bundle acts as a vanilla bundle in the way you can put items inside and take them out again in your inventory.
The ender bundle itself can not store anything, it's only usable after it is bound to a hopper (shift right click). 
When bound to a hopper, the hopper will display particles while holding the bundle close to it.

 

Ender Hopper



The ender hopper acts like a vanilla hopper, but you are able to bind an ender bundle to it. This bundle than has access to the hopper inventory:
- Items you put in the bundle appear in the hopper (and will be pulled from it if possible).
- You can take Items out of the hopper using the bundle (and the hopper will pull in new items).
This does not work if the hopper is locked with redstone (though you will still see the items inside the hopper in the bundle).

 

It is not meant to give you 5 more inventory slots (the hopper inventory). It is meant to be used to keep your inventory clean. 
Do you have too much cobblestone from mining? Put it in a bundle linked to your item storage. Do you need more food? Link it to a potato farm.
The possibilities are endless !
